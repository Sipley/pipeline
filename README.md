# pipeline

## Disclaimer

This was created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Scripting for Biologists graduate-level course, which I co-opted to improve the bioinformatics pipeline used in my MS thesis.  As such, it's probably only useful for me.

## Purpose

To survey the diversity of Venom Allergen-like Proteins (VAPs) across flatworm diversity

## Summary

1. Acquire 47 flatworms transcriptomes
2. Pull out predicted VAPs from all 47 transcriptomes (non-redundant)
3. Infer the best gene tree for VAPs
4. Test prediction that there are two main groups of VAPs, one of which is secretory and one of which is intracellular
5. Test prediction that rates of amino acid substitutions in secretory VAPs is greater on average than in intracellular VAPs
